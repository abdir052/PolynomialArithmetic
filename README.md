# PolynomialArithmetic
Course: CSCI 1913: Introduction to Algorithms,Data Structures, and Program Development



Polynomial arithmetic is a classic application of linked data structures like the ones discussed in the lectures. In this project, you will write a Java class that represents polynomials using singly linked linear lists. Its methods will add, subtract, and print these polynomials.
